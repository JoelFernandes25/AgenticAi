A collection of agentic AI systems I build — from reasoning agents to autonomous tool-using AI.
This repository will grow with every new agent I create.

Goal of This Repo

To document my journey building execution-capable AI, not just chatbots.
Every project here focuses on AI that can act, reason, and use tools like a real assistant.

Why This Repo Exists

I want a single place to store all agentic experiments — small to advanced — that help me (and others) understand the future of autonomous AI.

Note on Import Errors

Some import paths may look unusual — this is because LangChain often shifts several modules between packages.
I’ve updated the code accordingly, but older systems may show warnings depending on your version.
